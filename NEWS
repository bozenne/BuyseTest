* Version 1.3
** User visble changes - BuyseTest function
  - NEW FEATURE: boostrap resampling (method.inference = "boostrap")
  - NEW FEATURE: confint method to extract confidence intervals
  - argument n.permutation becomes n.resampling
  - argument method becomes method.tte
  - add argument method.inference to choose how to compute pvalues and
    CI.

** Internal change
  - reorganize BuyseTest into BuyseTest and .BuyseTest. Make
    initalization and testing of the arguments independent
  - remove dependency on tcltk.
  - confidence intervals and p.values are computed outside BuyseTest, when calling summary.

* Version 1.2
** User visble changes - BuyseTest function
  - add argument keepComparison, operator.
  - argument n.bootstrap becomes n.permuation
  - argument neutralAsUninf becomes neutral.as.uninf
  - nicer display with summary
  - lighter display when printing the object

** Internal change
  - reorganize the tests

* Version 1.1
  - add a formula argument to the BuyseTest function. This can be used instead of the treatment, endpoint, threshold, type, censoring, and strata argument
   to specify the prioritized endpoints.
  - unify the C++ code, add a threshold for considering a pair non-informative (w>1e-12). May induce differences with previous versions in the index of uniformative pairs.
  - uses prodlim instead of survival to compute the KM estimates.
  - Add a neutralAsUnif argument to the BuyseTest function to decide whether the analysis should continue on lower priority when a pair is classified as neutral
