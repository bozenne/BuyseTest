* Version 1.7
** User visble changes
- NEW FEATURE: iid function 

** Internal change
- fix bug in the computation of the asymptotic variance + add tests

* Version 1.6
** Internal change
  - simplify C++ code.

* Version 1.5
** User visble changes
  - Argument statistic now takes values netBenefit or winRatio
    (instead of netChance or winRatio).
  - NEW FEATURE: standard errors/p.values/confidence intervals can now
    be computed without resampling setting the option method.tte to asymptotic
  - NEW FEATURE: a function powerBuyseTest has been added to perform
    simulation studies with BuyseTest (e.g. compute power, coverage or bias).

** Internal change
  - improve the management of the weights of the pairs from one endpoint to another.

* Version 1.4
** User visble changes - BuyseTest function
  - NEW FEATURE: Instead of estimating the survival curves on the data
    used for the GPC, BuyseTest can use pre-defined survival models
    for method "Peron" (argument model.tte).
  - NEW FEATURE: methods getSurvival to access the survival
    probability used by BuyseTest.
  - NEW FEATURE: getPairScore to access the score of each pair.
  - NEW FEATURE: argument method.uninf in BuyseTest enables to
    re-attribute the uninformative scores to favorable/unfavorable/neutral.

** Internal change
- improve initSurvival and the computation of the Peron (C++ code)
- change the handling of NA in the survival when using method.tte="Peron" (C++ code)
- change the way neutralAsUninf is implemented (C++ code)

* Version 1.3
** User visble changes - BuyseTest function
  - NEW FEATURE: boostrap resampling (method.inference = "boostrap")
  - NEW FEATURE: confint method to extract confidence intervals
  - NEW FEATURE: BuyseTest can handle competing risks (experimental) 
  - argument n.permutation becomes n.resampling
  - argument method becomes method.tte
  - add argument method.inference to choose how to compute pvalues and
    CI.
  - option method.tte="Peto" and method.tte="Efron" have been removed.

** Internal change
  - reorganize BuyseTest into BuyseTest and .BuyseTest. Make
    initalization and testing of the arguments independent
  - remove dependency on tcltk.
  - confidence intervals and p.values are computed outside BuyseTest, when calling summary.

* Version 1.2
** User visble changes - BuyseTest function
  - add argument keepComparison, operator.
  - argument n.bootstrap becomes n.permuation
  - argument neutralAsUninf becomes neutral.as.uninf
  - nicer display with summary
  - lighter display when printing the object

** Internal change
  - reorganize the tests

* Version 1.1
  - add a formula argument to the BuyseTest function. This can be used instead of the treatment, endpoint, threshold, type, censoring, and strata argument
   to specify the prioritized endpoints.
  - unify the C++ code, add a threshold for considering a pair non-informative (w>1e-12). May induce differences with previous versions in the index of uniformative pairs.
  - uses prodlim instead of survival to compute the KM estimates.
  - Add a neutralAsUnif argument to the BuyseTest function to decide whether the analysis should continue on lower priority when a pair is classified as neutral
