Description: Implementation of the Generalized Pairwise Comparisons. This test
    enables to compare two groups of observations in randomized trials(e.g treated
    vs. control patients) on several prioritized outcomes. Pairwise comparisons
    require consideration of all possible pairs of individuals, one taken from the
    treatment group and the other taken from the control group. The outcomes of the
    two individuals forming a pair are compared. Thresholds of minimal clinically
    significant differences can be defined. It is possible to analyse simultaneously
    several outcomes by prioritizing the variables that capture them. The highest
    priority is assigned to the variable considered the most clinically relevant.
    A natural way of handling uninformative or neutral pairs is to consider the
    outcomes in descending order of priority: whenever a pair is uninformative or
    neutral for an outcome of higher priority, the outcomes of lower priority are
    examined In the case of time-to-event endpoint, four methods to handle censored
    observations are available in this package (Gehan, Peto, Efron, and Peron).
