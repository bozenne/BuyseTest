** test-BT_noStrata
Test BuyseTest without strata
- check whether the number of pairs displayed in the summary is ok (e.g. total = favorable + unfavorable + neutral + uninf)
- check consistency with existing tests
- check consistency with results from previous version (on common slots)

** test-BT_strata
Test BuyseTest with strata
- check whether the number of pairs displayed in the summary is ok (e.g. total = favorable + unfavorable + neutral + uninf)
- check whether when using identical values across strata, the result is the same across strata
- check consistency with results from previous version (on common slots)

** test-Julien

** test-initSurvival
Test the computation of the survival
- no strata: Check jump at t- and no jump at t+ in the estimated survival by KM
- no strata: Check survival=NA after last event if censored else death (rational being that we do not know what it would be for censored but we do know that the survival if 0 if everybody is dead)
- no strata and strata: check identical with previous version

** test-parallel
Test BuyseTest with parallel bootstra
- check consistency with results from previous version (on common slots)

** test-valid
