* Tests

** test-BuysePower
Just check that powerBuyseTest runs in a simple setting.
** test-BuyseTest-checkValues
Check against known output when considering many pairs (binary,
continuous, time to event, mixed endpoint) with and without strata.
** test-BuyseTest-correctionTTE
Check the IPCW correction for method.tte="Gehan" and
method.tte="Peron".
** test-BuyseTest-CR
Check that using competing risks is equivalent to using the pseudo
survival times.
** test-BuyseTest-iid
Check the computation of the variance based on the asymptotic theory (i.e. method.inference="u-statisitc")
- for scoring.rule="Gehan"
- for scoring.rule="Peron"
** test-BuyseTest-neutralAsUnif
Test whether the argument neutral.as.uninf works:
- on an example without NA
- on an example with NA
** test-BuyseTest-operator
Test whether the argument operator="<0" and operator=">0" works on a simple example.
** test-BuyseTest-PairScore
Check tableComparison matches the summary of BuyseTest objects
** test-BuyseTest-Pairs
Test BuyseTest on tractable examples:
- count of positive, negative, neutral, uniformative pairs
- delta and Delta net Chance and win Ratio
** test-BuyseTest-previousBug
Check that issues that have been reported are indeed fixed.
** test-BuyseTest-resampling
Check permutation and bootstrap resampling
** test-iid-prodlim
Check the computation of the iid decomposition of the Kaplan-Meier estimator:
- compare to the one obtained with the riskRegression package (without and with strata)
** test-initSurvival
Check the computation of the survival using Kaplan Meier:
- no strata: Check jump at t- and no jump at t+ in the estimated survival by KM.
- no strata: Check survival=NA after last event if censored else death.
(rational being that we do not know what it would be for censored but we do know that the survival if 0 if everybody is dead)
- strata: check identical with other strata if all strata are identical.
- strata and no strata: check consistency with results from previous version (version >1.2)
** test-initThreshold
Check correct intialization of the threshold in the user interface.
** test-otherPackage
Not run. Used to compare the estimation of the win ratio with the
library WWR, winRatioAnalysis, and WLreg.
