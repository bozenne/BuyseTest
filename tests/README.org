* Tests

** test-initThreshold
Check correct intialization of the threshold in the user interface.

** test-initSurvival
Check the computation of the survival using Kaplan Meier:
- no strata: Check jump at t- and no jump at t+ in the estimated survival by KM.
- no strata: Check survival=NA after last event if censored else death.
(rational being that we do not know what it would be for censored but we do know that the survival if 0 if everybody is dead)
- strata: check identical with other strata if all strata are identical.
- strata and no strata: check consistency with results from previous version (version >1.2)

** test-BuyseTest-Pairs
Test BuyseTest on tractable examples:
- count of positive, negative, neutral, uniformative pairs
- delta and Delta net Chance and win Ratio

** test-BuyseTest-operator
Test whether the argument operator="<0" and operator=">0" works on a simple example.

** test-BuyseTest-neutralAsUnif
Test whether the argument neutral.as.uninf works:
- on an example without NA
- on an example with NA

** test-BuyseTest-previousBug
Test issues reported by users:
- incorrect management of pairs with neutral.as.uninf

** test-BuyseTest-checkValues
Check against known output in complex cases
** test-BuyseTest-correctionTTE
Check method.tte="Gehan corrected" and method.tte="Peron corrected"
** test-resampling
Check permutation and bootstrap resampling
* TODO
** test-BuyseTest-correctionTTE: test for case with two survival endpoints (same or different endpoints)
